OpenGL Utility Library 
====================

Abstract some basics for OpenGL on different platforms.

Design Principles
--------------------------
* KISS - Keep it small and simple
* Lightweight
* Cross Platform (currently aiming for linux/posix and windows, mac osx support can added easily)
* Documentation - Try to provide well documented code

Features
--------------------
* Event/Message Loop Handling
* OpenGL Window
* Input Handling
* Xlib/Win32 Backend
  (Some XCB Code is available, because of lacking xcb glx support at the moment inactive)
